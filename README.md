🛒 FreshMart
Full-Stack Grocery E-Commerce Application

FreshMart is a full-stack grocery shopping platform built with the MERN stack principles. It enables users to seamlessly browse products, manage carts, and place orders, while providing admins with complete inventory control through a secure dashboard.
